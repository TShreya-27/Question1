# Lab Experiment Assignment Web App

## Project Overview
This web application addresses the issue of students receiving identical lab questions, which can lead to inefficiency and unfair evaluation. The app provides:
- Login/Signup for students and faculty
- Student dashboard with unique but equally difficult lab questions
- Faculty dashboard to view student-question assignments
